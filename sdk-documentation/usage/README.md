# âš™ Usage

To use Gizo SDK in your app, follow these steps:

* To start to use the SDK, we need to start the [Gizo Analysis](gizo-analysis.md). For this reason, we need a lifecycle like an activity or a fragment and implement some lines of code in Main Activity. Based on the settings applied by the developers, a series of features will be added to the SDK.
* The SDK requires certain [permissions ](permissions.md)in order to function properly. These permissions are necessary to enable the GPS setting, capture videos, Mapbox navigation & saving files in the download folder.
* The SDK provides several [options ](app-options/)that can be configured at the app level to customize its behavior. These options can be set in the Application class of your app.
* [Model ](app-options/gizoanalysissettings.md#step-1-adding-model)loading, which was explained in the Analysis setting.
* Using a [listener](listeners.md), which is a mechanism that allows you to register a listener object that will be notified when a specific event occurs. The listener object contains a set of callback methods that will be called by the system when the associated event occurs. These events include Analysis, IMU Sensors, GPS, Video, Battery, and Orientation.
