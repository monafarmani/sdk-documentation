# GizoBatterySetting

## Overview

&#x20;Battery settings on MyTestSDK library refer to the configuration and management options related to the deviceâ€™s battery usage and performance. These settings allow users to monitor and control the battery usage of their mobile devices.

Gizo battery setting is used to customize some behavior and functionality of our library, including specifying the minimum percentage of battery charge that Analysis options can be implemented, The minimum percentage of battery charge that Recording video can be implemented, A loop of time for getting battery status in 1 second, and so on ...

To have access to battery setting options, you need to add these lines of code in the Application class, onCreate function, inside Gizo.initialize.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Kotlin" %}
```kotlin
.batterySetting(
    GizoBatterySetting.Builder()
         .checkBattery(true)
         .lowBatteryLimit(25f)
         .lowBatteryStop(15f)
         .interval(5000L)
        .build()
)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The `GizoBatterySetting` builder sets the battery-related properties such as `checkBattery` (enabling battery monitoring), `lowBatteryLimit` (the threshold below which the battery is considered low, set to 25%), `lowBatteryStop` (the threshold at which certain operations should be stopped, set to 15%), and `interval` (the interval at which the battery status is checked, set to 5000 milliseconds).

Finally, the `build()` method is called on the `GizoAppOptions.Builder()` instance to create a `GizoAppOptions` object with the configured battery settings.

This code suggests that the `GizoAppOptions` class specifies various configuration options for the `Gizo` application, including battery-related settings. The specific implementation and usage of `GizoAppOptions` would depend on the details of the `Gizo` application itself.



Here are the available options that can be set in batterySetting in the Application class:

<table><thead><tr><th width="252">Options</th><th width="167.33333333333331">Default Value</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>checkBattery(Boolean)</td><td>false</td><td>To allow to check the battery status or not.</td></tr><tr><td>lowBatteryLimit(Float)</td><td>25f</td><td>The minimum percentage of battery charge that Analysis options can be implemented.</td></tr><tr><td>lowBatteryStop(Float)</td><td>15f</td><td>The minimum percentage of battery charge that Recording video can be implemented.</td></tr><tr><td>interval(Long)</td><td>5000L</td><td>A loop of time for getting battery status in 1 second.</td></tr></tbody></table>
